This project includes geometric data and models originally based on the work of Haj-Ali et al. (2012) titled 
"A general three-dimensional parametric geometry of the native aortic valve and root for biomechanical modeling." 
The original work is copyrighted by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The surface geometry was reconstructed in Creo using the parametric curves provided by Haj-Ali et al. 
The surface geometry served as the foundation for creating the volumetric model, which was subsequently generated and processed in LS-PrePost for further analysis.
