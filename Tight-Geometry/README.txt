The files AorticValveGeometry_1.proj to AorticValveGeometry_6.proj contain the
geometry of the heart valve leaflets. For detailed information on the content of
these files, please refer to the document Generate Heart Valve Geometry.docx.

Files with the suffix _Middle and _Fine contain the medium and fine meshes,
respectively. Files without a mesh density suffix starting from
AorticValveGeometry_3.proj contain the coarse mesh.

AorticValveGeometry_7_Middle.proj to AorticValveGeometry_14_Middle.proj contain
the individual steps used to construct the fluid geometry.

The files AorticValveMesh_Coarse.k, AorticValveMesh_Middle.k, and
AorticValveMesh_Fine.k contain the final structural meshes in text format for use
with the LS-DYNA solver. 

All files can be opened and viewed with LS-PrePost.
